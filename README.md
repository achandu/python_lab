This repo harbors my experiments using python. 

Few of the experiments are from coding exercises from HackerRank and Codeeval. I would be adding my experiments as I work over various programs.

List of the programs as of now:

1. [HR] Median:		Median of a stream of integers and it's operations

2. [HR] MaxToys: 	Maximum number of unique toys to be bought for the specified price

3. [HR] Flowers: 	Print the minimum amount of money you and your friends have to pay in order to buy all N flowers.
